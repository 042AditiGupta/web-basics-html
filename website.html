        <h1>Travel</h1>

        <p>Our favourite inspirational travel quotes have encouraged us to travel with abandon over the years. Perhaps they will do the same for you… For us, there is no such thing as luxury travel; travel is, by default, a luxury. It is a privilege provided
            by the country of our birth, a privilege that many are not as fortunate to enjoy.

    <h1>about travelling</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, we have to pinch ourselves at just how ridiculous our lives have become: an ex-teacher and jobbing writer travelling the world for a living. It is absurd, it is astonishing, it is a luxury. When I first went travelling at 21 years old,
        my father gave me this quote scrawled on a piece of card</p>
